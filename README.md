<h2>About me</h2>
### My Story
I like to code, as apparent with my continuous github activity. I am a good problem solver and in a relationship with coding since my 11th grade when I was first introduced coding. Coding felt, um, natural to me. One thing that I love the most about coding is it changes the way how you think. I read somewhere before, a language that does not change the way you think is not worth learning. I loved that statement and hence, I am comfortable with different kinds of languages, let it be the old school C, or the modern python... even the less heard by the current generation lisp or functional programming language like haskell. I have coded in all these languages at some point of time, sometimes for a project while sometimes for fun.

### Language Timeline
The following is my entry and exit programming languages (mostly temporal in nature)
**C -> C++ -> Java -> Lisp -> Python -> Haskell -> Javascript -> Dart -> Javascript -> Python (Current)**

About problem solving, try me :) I love fun challenges...

I have **mentored** many individuals, during undergrad as well as now I mentor people, ofc for free so reach me out if you want to learn something, maybe collab? I love mentoring, feels good to make some difference. :smile:

Project wise, I keep doing something or the other. I can't keep updating readme so, well, maybe my github pins might help. Do note that my recent/research work are not uploaded before I actually complete it fully. Like my current serverless function recommendation, its a good one! :P. In general I have worked in the field of App Development (have 3-4 apps on playstore), WebDevelopment [check this website out](https://projectsell-594d7.web.app) its fully functional, made from scratch. Different ML domains like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning, Time Series Data Analysis (I love it, ofc stocks.) Currently I am focusing on **Deep Learning and Serverless computing analysis and Serverless for Edge.**

If you have job opportunities for any of these domains feel free to reach out to me. **Software Engineering** included.

Ahhh, also, feel free to look out for these websites: [www.sarveshbhatnagar.com](http://www.sarveshbhatnagar.com) , [introtoalgo.com](https://www.introtoalgo.com) Yes I own this domain... its good right? :P I have plans for maintaining it more actively after March 2022. Finally, [stacklearn.org](https://www.stacklearn.org)

I am very active on github... **Proof**

I guess missed it, well have a look at my github tile... :)
